<h1>HTML Activity: CRAP Principles Website Analysis</h1>
<p>I am conducting my analysis on Auburn University's homepage for first my GitHub Pages website!</p>
<h2>Contrast</h2> 
<p2>Overall, the Auburn University homepage exhibits the contrast design principle well. The homepage exhibits contrast through text in varying bold orange, blue, and white hues against the complementary backdrops of vivid photos and content boxes. However, there is a glaring error when it pertains to the homepage’s color contrast element as well. One is not able to read the fact about Auburn being selected as a top college with the best student life in America on the infographic prominently displaying the university’s mascot, “Aubie.” The navy-blue text of the fact is illegible against the backdrop of Aubie’s burnt orange arm. Furthermore, the homepage displays prominent size, font, and spatial contrast elements, as well as nicely contrasting key concepts, important quotes and statistics, and call-to-action elements that bolster the university’s image and messaging. </p2>

<h3>Repetition</h3> 
<p3>The Auburn University homepage exudes the repetition design element pertaining to its orange, blue, and white color schemes and photographs with vivid hues. As far as visual elements, the homepage exudes repetition through standardized topography and repeated use of the same type of content boxes and other graphic elements. However, the spacing seems to vary more than desired throughout the page and the stories section contains photos, graphics, and text that vary in size, placement, and design. </p3>
